Californium (Cf) CoAP framework in Java
=======================================

Californium is a Java CoAP implementation targeting back-end services. Thus, the
focus is on usability and features, not on resource-efficiency like for embedded
devices. The Java implementation fosters quick server and client development.

This branch represents the security part of CoAP, namely the implementation of
Datagram Transport Layer Security.
